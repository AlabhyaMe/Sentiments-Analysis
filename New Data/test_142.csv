"A pitiful, shame that in order to have any forward momentum on my case I have to come to your unmarked building and wait more than two hours to speak with some disrespectful worker who in my opinion, had a problem with me because I was black based on the fact that he was friendly and courteous to every Spanish-speaking individual that saw him before me, and yet as I am Asking questions he could not even contain his disdain for me and was quite rude. Responding to me as I had to dig out every single step needed to be done in order to get my case moving forward. It would be a whole lot easier if you're online resource had more clear , step-by-step instruction on how to update my case and receive a realistic set of instructions to resolve small issues. I do not like coming into this office, especially when the only friendly people I speak with are the security guards. You could also stand to increase your call center staff to avoid not ever being able to reach a live person",N

"clients are taking time away from their care to come here, only to be turned away because they don't speak the language. This feels discriminatory. I offered to translate for a person ( I am an advocate I came here to help a claimant) , but I was told this would violate confidentiality. However, conversations in your office are already audible to everyone present, so there's no real confidentiality. It's essential that people are fully supported in navigating their application here, including language assistance if needed.",N
Couldn't get any help. They stopped giving numbers to be assisted at 930am. When asked if I could get a number was rudely told to come in the morning.,N

"Dear EDD Leadership and Administration,  I am extremely frustrated with the lack of support and communication. Waiting times to speak with a representative are unacceptable, and no one answers the phone, forcing me to visit the office. The online system provides no updates on my case, and there's no clear guidance on additional documents needed. I had to go in person to learn that a worker's compensation denial letter was requiredƒ??a detail that should have been communicated via the portal or mail.  Additionally, the system doesn't allow for uploading documents, and warnings about duplicate submissions only cause delays add confusion. This lack of clarity is unfair, especially as many rely on these benefits to cover essential expenses. After months of waiting with no money and no updates, the process is causing unnecessary hardship. I urge EDD to improve communication and provide clearer guidance for clients. ",N
"Don't tell people to call in if they cannot even reach anyone, completely pointless. Just tell people to come in the office.",N
"Edd needs to revert back to Bank of America because we get paid days late with money network and EDD needs more phone representatives. The MAXIMUM NUMBER OF CALLERS IS ALWAYS REACHED ALLDAY. I can never get in touch with a representative. It's unacceptable. I've not been paid my benefits since [DATE]. I'm requesting of Edd interest and penalty fees! You receive your money every two weeks with no delay when I'm working. Why haven't I received payments in last two months?.. Please call me concerning these issues. Thank you.  Respectfully, [NAME]  [PHONE NUMBER1] [PHONE NUMBER2]",N
"Employees at this location lie and say they will come talk to you and give you the required paperwork needed. They refuse to take accountability for not processing paperwork they received in a timely manner and they refuse to reach out to the claimant when there is any additional paperwork needed, or if the claimant needs to be resubmitted. No one answers the phones, the government should really get its shit together and help Americans instead of worsen their conditions. ",N
"Everyone in the office takes lunch at the same time at 2 pm . They put us in line in a small room and told us to stand shoulder to shoulder to fit everyone about 60 people in a small room. This is a fire and health concern. Everyone took they're lunch with 60 people waiting in the little waiting room. Management needs training on staff scheduling so the office can provide quality service and work efficiently. I have not got paid in more than a month and all they tell me is that it will be processed soon. When this same situation happened in October and my payments were delayed one young lady ensured to assist me and proceeded my payments. Only time this office was useful. Security telling everyone to ""move forward there's a lot of space "" has obviously not had fire safety training. I'm asthmatic and immunocomprimised to have atleast 12 inches of distance between the person behind me and person infront of me is a right . Disgusting office",N

"I came to the office to turn in documents that a telephone representative told me I needed. I faxed and mailed the documents and did not hear anything back from EDD after the post office confirmed delivery.

I begged him to take my documents and he walked away and never returned. I have him on video. I felt helpless and defeated at that moment because I've been waiting for payment since [DATE1]. It's [DATE2] and nothing.   Feel free to contact me for proof. [PHONE NUMBER]",N

This is not a one time thing because of the holidays. Every month I am forced to visit the office with my newborn and I experience long wait times, exhausted and rude employees who don't have access to the PFL accounts. This is exhausting and not how I envisioned spending BONDING TIME with my newborn. I work hard at my job that I have been at for 20 years.

"I had to wait 20+ minutes standing to get a number. People with disabilities impacting their ability to stand were negatively impacted. Once I got a number I had to wait a total of 2 hours to see one of two representatives in a terribly understaffed office to get a form which reasonably should be available for download on the  EDD website or set out on a wall or counter. The two representatives helping customers went intervals of 10-15+ minutes without helping a new customer.

"I strongly recommend that the Paid Family Care Leave department consider expanding its resources, whether through additional offices or more staff to handle phone inquiries. Since opening my application, I have been unable to reach anyone through the 877 number. Regardless of the day or time, the automated system consistently informs me that the maximum number of callers has been reached, directing me to try again later.    It was only by chance that I discovered visiting an EDD office in person is the most reliable way to speak with someone. Unfortunately, this required me to take time off work to travel to [CITY], causing me to lose income in addition to the delayed payments due to the reliance on traditional mail for communication.    This process has been both frustrating and costly, and I hope improvements can be made to better support those relying on these critical benefits.",N
I think there should be more automated methods to be able to work with someone like online chat. It's physically painful to be at the office during this disabling time and have to pay an uber since you're never able to get an agent on the phone. The inbox site does not work. It says you will receive a response in 7-10 days but it's been 3 weeks and still no response. We should be able to see details of where our claim is and why things are pending any why payments have not been sent. Even coming into the office you are not given information ,N
I waited for 6 hours to get my question answered in 2 minutes. Perhaps hiring more employees or moving people allowing based on the reason for their visit would be more productive. ,N

I was told someone would call me in two hours to go ahead and leave. No customer service in person. ,N
I was unable to file a claim because I was told by EDD that someone else had used my SSN.  The wait and service in [CITY] is horrible!  The African American security guard on [DATE] was rude and aggressive!  The windows didn't service customers for long periods of time. ,N
I was unable to get ahold of anyone via phone. I have called every day for two weeks and the line aid that it was too busy.

It is absolutely impossible to get a hold of someone on the phone. Completely ridiculous that I have to drive down to [CITY] since there are no closer offices to me. I have to bring my sick 4 month baby with me in this cold weather since I don't have daycare right now. I have called 5 days a week and all throughout the office hours and have not spoken to anyone. It's as if they let the phones just ring and ring. Either hire more people or tell the ones you have to do their jobs and answer phones.,N
It is absolutely ridiculous that there is very little information provided to you on the portal and it is IMPOSSIBLE to get through on the phone.

It was very difficult to hear the customer representative.  I think the mic volume was turned low.  This was aggravating the client being served before me.  He kept complaining that the other customers were talking and he couldn't hear the person helping him.  This was not true.  The person next to him was speaking with his rep.  When I got to the window I kept having to tell the rep that I couldn't hear him.  This alone causes unnecessary aggravation ,N

There was an issue with my claim a few months ago and it was cleared up. Well, or so I thought. I keep getting messed up when i have to do a continued claim certification. Yet I can't get it done by phone because you can't get through ( I've called over 300 times in one day to to avail) canyon get it done at the office and they won't mail the form.

Not enough staff to help claimants  Staff over worked Waiting period is way too long Privacy is not warranted  Staff and security very rude ,N
"Office was very disorganized.  The workers are overworked and we're not treated respectfully. The waiting room was very small. You can hear the conversations of people in the counter. There's no privacy so other people can hear your business.  The only redeeming quality is the security officer. His name is [EMPLOYEE'S NAME].

They can't help me at the downtown office so now I have to wait 42 days That I should've been counting in already because I have to mail the claim form which is ridiculous when I have an account. ",N
"Since you don't answer any phone call makes it hard for me to come in person to just get my question answered however the wait time is over 2 hours, people who are in disability are not able to travel easily that is why they're on disability but it seems you are careless and you don't care about any feedback ",N
Staff was not ready when the office opened they were still getting ready to start the day at open 8am. The first window was not friendly and didn't ask questions so that I would be able to get application in the lobby area. Instead I waited for my turn and come yo find out it wasn't necessary at all.

"[EMPLOYEE'S NAME] is rude, uncaring and a complete dumpsterfire. She actually had the audacity to tell me ""Just go get a job."" Hmmm, why did I not think of that? Did it ever occur, that, I am applying for disability because I am disabled? Did that ever cross her mind? Is this what representatives think is normal behavior? To treat the constituent like crap and discriminate them and act like their disability is not worthy? Do I have to be dying and dragging myself on the ground to be considered? Outrageous and Pathetic.",N

The employees here are great! Everyone here is very helpful and very patient with everyone. The only thing that is needed here in my opinion is a speaker outside that announces the numbers. That would help out a lot. I think that would keep people from blocking the door. Besides that Ty guys for all your hard work. ,P
"The lady that helped me today was very helpful, but the wait time is ridiculous and waiting on a phone call is worse, they only call once should at least try twice and when I was on a a phone call the representative had a bad attitude and put me on hold for over three hours and the call was disconnected. I'm concerned because she said my address was not correct when I've been at the same address for the last six years very difficult process when all I need is a receipt number for my doctor ",N
The lines are outrageous. Questions are not answered. Disability always makes it so difficult to get paid. ,N
The office is very small and they is an issue with security by providing your personal information on a piece of paper and then putting it in a window where other people could have access to. It is very easy to see someone else's information and it should be fixed immediately. Please provide a more secure way to provide personal information to worker. ,N
"The online responses feel unhelpful and impersonal, almost as if an AI is replying without understanding my issue. Additionally, they don't answer the phone, so I visited their office in person.

The operations process is completely outdated. I have been waiting for benefits since July. I keep receiving mixed information regarding my claim. It should not take this long. I am disappointed in this government.,N
The people you have like the security guards and the black lady and the Mexican lady downstairs helping check people in tear people worse then animals. People are here because they are sick and to be treated less than human is disrespectful and disgusting. These people you have hired for security need to go back for training. I was told to get out of a chair because the security guard was going to sit!!! If she is working then they should not be sitting on their asses shoveling food in their face and socializing while treating people like animals. I will report this to the state. This treatment is unacceptable. The customers coming in should be able to have 1 person with them and not be treated badly. My husband had 2 heart attacks in 1 week and I was treated badly because my husband wanted me by his side!!!!! Your Inter-Con employees need to be replaced all of the so called females!!!! I want a call to discuss [PHONE NUMBER],N
The process has been horrendous. Had to file an appeal.  Won appeal in April and agent never filed appeal for 6 months. Had to come into office with paperwork copies. Now 22 months after filing I'm still waiting for a response. I'm told I have to wait for the agent at the hearing in April to ok the ruling g of a judge. Most financially devastating experience ever. ,N
The representatives were very rude and dismissive! Also the guy at the window was dismissive to me but when the Hispanic lady came and asked for a manager just as I did she immediately got a manager!

"The reps are always helpful. However, after physically dropping off paperwork in-person 2 months ago and getting no response, I came to the office and waited 4 hours for the reps to tell me my paperwork was lost . . . I had printed 1.5 years of paystubs from 3 employers, an Excel spreadsheet with 1.5 years worth of hours worked and a 2 page statement lost and have been waiting for issues to resolve since my last payment [DATE]. This was so heartbreaking!! A manager apologized and asked me to fax some of the documents. I'm back at the office waiting hours 1-2 weeks later praying my paperwork was not lost again. Meanwhile, I'm facing eviction, had to pull my kids out of their Christian school last month, my car is in repossession, can barely buy food, don't qualify for any other services and have had multiple delays in medical care, so my condition has worsened and yet no one can help me. Please, there has to be an easier way than this. [NAME], [CLAIM NUMBER]",N
The security guard is allowing people to jump a long line outside and not providing any control or instruction to everyone waiting. He is just on his phone watching videos. Very upsetting after I've seen some people pass me while waiting in line for more than an hour. ,N

"The staff here are horrible. I had to make numerous trips to that location while recovering from [SURGERY].

I was given a receipt number with a letter on it which was incorrect and when I asked them to change it they said I had to get another ticket number and wait 3 more hrs. I've been coming down here for months and yet to be given info that allows me to receive payment. As I am about to have another surgery I need to receive income. The security guards here are ill mannered, unhelpful, and untrained to deal with the capacity/ demographic of the people who come to get help. Also for people who are disabled like me and can't sit for more than 10 min without pain there are no ways  to get in contact with anyone so we're forced to be subjected to this treatment. ",N

"There's a really long wait, they don't have a translator for those who don't speak English, some of the staff it's really rude there's only two windows sometimes one this is crazy they need help",N
"They do not care about the people who come to this office. We all where burning up in the sun. The security guard moved the line to the shade and a state employee came out and to everyone to get back on the other side with no shade. There where babies, elderly and obviously people with disabilities. No consideration what so ever.",N
"They need a PA system for the people waiting outside. There was babies in the loby and the cold air from opening the door to call out numbers was ridiculous, other times security goes out and lets people know outside but the one today was just on his phone the whole time and people missed their numbers",N
They need translators provided for clients ,N
"They take to long with costumers,, I checked the time, they take like 20 minutes with customer, they take to long",O
"This facility needs more bilingual employees with a secondary language in Spanish. Majority of the over head are Hispanics which most of the time need interpretation either by security, or good samaritans going out their way. Every visit I come to is the same scenario each time. Which is why the lines take a lot longer to move. I respect the Hispanic security here for always going above and beyond to help anyone in here in anyway he can. He brings a great presentation of customer service. ",O
This has been the worst experience. I tried calling no matter what time or day of the week I could never get through. I went to the office in  [CITY] and the service is extremely slow  you want in one room for the to call your number when your number is called you think you are about to be serve NO YOU JUST GO TO ANOTHER ROOM AND WAIT !!! There are only 3 windows in [CITY] that is not enough  And then I waited in line and they said we can't help you with FMLA paperwork. I was there over 3 1/2 hours please call  please call to advise [PHONE NUMBER],N
This is a terrible feeling waiting to get paid when you have bills to pay and a family to take care of,N
"This is a very horrible process, I have been trying to file a claim for 3 weeks and the information on the automated system is not helpful the representatives that call you back are not helpful or knowledgeable.You have security guards asking people questions as if the are state employees. This is not and have not been a reasonable experience to say the least, in fact it's and overwhelming horrible experience while trying to recover from surgery.",N
"This office in [STREET NAME, CITY] is impeccable, extremely efficient and useful. This is my second time coming here. Great customer service and support. Congratulations. ",P
This office is not ran efficiently. Not helpful,N
This office was no help the people were very rude and unhelpful seems as if they get joy out of making things difficult or they are lazy and want to push it to the next person instead of providing the help you need ,N
"This place is a hell hole, and the phone service is worse. Literally embarrassing that this is the best our state and government can offer. ",N
"This process us horrific. We are tax payers treated like garbage. Phone lines are busy, not available. Office representatives rude.",N
"This visit was by far the WORST experience. I do not mind waiting when needed but there needs to be a better system to notify those waiting when their number is up. The staff was beyond rude not only to myself but to others. No sign of empathy or care. This is the disability department and yet there is no sign of accommodations to those individuals with disabilities. Making them go up & down to check on their number every few minutes. No sign of empathy from the employees to those who are going through a hard time & trust me do NOT want to be there. An employee told someone ""LIKE I SAID NO MORE NUMBERS WHAT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND? RETURN TOMORROW WHAT DONT YOU GET? EVERYONE MAKES IT SO DIFFICULT ITS NOT HARD TO UNDERSTAND"". Beyond rude. ",N
"Tickets should be given as people are in order seated prior to getting a ticket once sent upstairs, keeping waiting order fair unlike now. Individuals who are just being seated are being seen prior to people who have been waiting longer. Worker was very helpful with issue. Current set up allows everyone in room to hear your personal situation. Online accounts should allow registration for individuals with longer names. Phone system for SDI is complete trash, not one time able to speak to a representative.",N
"Today we just so happened to get a gentleman who was patient and took the time to listen and explain. He actually seemed to care. Times prior to today it was the run around with lack of knowledge, information given and lack of empathy. Just another number.  FYI- I was only present to assist a friend who's suffered from a stroke. So I've been present to witness the workflows as well as the lack of customer service.",O
Very bad service The lady I got was rude ,N
Very helpful representative over the phone she also made sure to put notes down so that they expedite my claim ,P
Very rude and not helpful,N
Very unprofessional. Promises to call me back but they never do. No updates and no effort to provide any updates. No one cares here. Do your job please. ,N
Wait times are so long people just leave ,N
We came into the [CITY] office for more info EDD rep [CITY]  was rude disrespectful threw my ID back to me. This is not the first time I've seen him act like this it just wasn't to me another person in EDD at the time,N
"We drove down to the office and was told everything was taken care of, but before we even got home we got a call asking questions while we were on the road. Why weren't the questions posed while we there? Then the person said they just needed to know if we were helped. Yes, up to the point we got the phone call, then we turned around to head back to the office. Then we got a call from a manager who said everything was fine. Someone needs to train the person who made that first call.",N
Website constantly down for maintenance. Turned in forms online was great for months now past 2 months resent forms multiple times with no website update. Office visit: Wait time [CITY] I arrived at 8am it is now 11:20 and I am still waiting just for paperwork only 2 windows to help over 100 people. When calling in there is No representative available due to high call volume. Tried calling multiple times and says no representative available.  I just need to change return to work date! ,N
"When we come to office and they make us sit for a phone call rather than seeing someone in person, usually ( at least for me ) the times I have been helped on the phone , nothing gets resolved for me even if they say they will help me . Also I need someone to bring me because I'm disabled and can't drive so they make me waste the time of the person that helps me and it adds on stress and financial hardships as well.   Today that I'm here the person intake people said that there were 20 people ahead of me to see someone in person but at the office there weren't even 10 people in the chairs waiting . Also, it's the attitude we receive from them so unnecessary all I am trying to do here is resolve anything needed of my case.   When I've tried to call instead of coming in ,,, the calls always drop they never go through ",N
"Why is so difficult to receive my money it been 11 weeks and it's the same cutover and over!!  Pls.. help me!! I'm losing my car, and behind on my rent. Pls make it easier for seniors to get our money",N
Why office disability NEVER answers calls???. So many people need to speak with representatives. We don't have a car to be driving to the offices . We need to be able to speak with someone from disability office. They are Never Available!!! Is very disappointing.,N
With all do respect. I am very disappointed that I've been calling all day and different times of the day and you can never speak to a person. Also I have turned in my application and it's been 20 days with no response. In my opinion the system is broken and can be fixed and updated to help anyone who calls. I am still waiting for a response.  Thank you for your time ,N
Worker sitting outside was very rude and told us in a rude manner that we were not allowed to stand in the hallway to wait as we were standing in the hallway with our newborn since it was extremely crowded in the small waiting area. ,N
Worse EDD office in the state. Cannot get a number to talk to a representative.  Office should hire more staff.,N
"Yes more agents need to be available to answer phone calls, and more personal when you visit in person, the way is set up is too slow and csn be improved by simply horinv mord agents. ",N
You guys need more workers at this location! The line took forever ,N
You keep changing way to be serviced at this location. First wait in line then wait for phone call.  Now it's grab a number.  Get your stuff together or answer the phone ,N
Your systems need redesigning. It is not clear to the citizens what it is they should do. I would recommend you working with a consulting firm like Accenture to help with the redesign of the application process and your online instructions. Or you could place this all into ChatGPT and use that to help you redesign your application processes. ,N
Your workers do not care about their job. Lazy and rude. We have bills to pay. I don't understand why no one here takes it seriously. ,N
